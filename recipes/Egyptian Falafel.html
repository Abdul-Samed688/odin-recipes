    <p>Egyptian falafel is an all-time favorite street food in Egypt. In most parts of the Middle East, falafel is made with ground chickpeas. In Egypt however, we make it with dried fava beans. These are best served with pita bread, tomato, onions, and tahini sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dried split fava beans</li>
        <li>1 red onion, quartered</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

    </ul>
